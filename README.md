## Description

A small project to try out building a full stack webapp.
Intended to be a simple Planning Poker webapp.

Split into a Rust/Arctix backend and a Typescript/React frontend.

See their relevant readmes for more details:
- [Backend Readme](./backend/README.md)
- Frontend Readme (not written yet)

## Dev environment

The dev environment uses devcontainers so you shouldn't need to setup the environment yourself. Just opening a devcontainer should be enough to start development.
I intend to create one devcontainer for the backend, and a separate devcontainer for the frontend.
So far only the backend devcontainer has been created.
